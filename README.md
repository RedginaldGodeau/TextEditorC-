# TEXT EDITOR C#
This is a C# program that provides a basic text editor in the console. The program allows the user to input text by typing on the keyboard, and to move the cursor left and right, as well as insert a new line. When the user presses the escape key, the program prompts the user to save the inputted text to a file. If the user presses 'y' or 'Y', the program outputs "Saving...", otherwise it outputs "Exit...". The program was made by Redginald Godeau.
